## What is PHP?
PHP is a high-level general-purpose programming language that was specially designed for the development of web applications.

It is interpreted, cross-platform, open source, which has been very popular in recent years.

What is NOT PHP?

It is not a compiled language, so you will always have to carry your code and your interpreter together.
It is not designed to make desktop applications.
To work with PHP we will install a development environment called XAMPP, it is not an environment designed for production.

## PHP SYNTAX
Whenever we use PHP we will use the following: <? Php?> Everything we put inside this will be what the server will interpret as php code, whatever is outside it will ignore it.

To access it we will do it localhost: 8080 / hello.php because the server opens the index file by default and our new file is called hello.php.

If we want to write php code in our HTML view we will have to change the file extension to .php because our server is configured to interpret only PHP files. Only the parts within <? Php?> They will be interpreted and their source code will not be visible from the browser.

All code statements are separated by a; (semicolon).
